            <h2>Johnny Truant</h2>
            <p class="character1">
              Johnny Truant serves a dual role, as primary editor of Zampanò's
              academic study of The Navidson Record and protagonist as revealed
              through footnotes and appendices. In the beginning of the book,
              Truant appears to be a normal, reasonably attractive young man who
              happens upon a trunk full of notes left behind by the now deceased
              Zampanò. As Truant begins to do the editing, however, he begins to
              lose the tenuous grip he has on reality, and his life begins to
              erode around him. He stops bathing, rarely eats, stops going to
              work, and distances himself from essentially everyone, all in
              pursuit of organizing the book into a finished work that, he
              hopes, will finally bring him peace.

            <h2>Zampanò</h2>
            <p class="character2">
              Though Truant attributes Zampanò as the author of The Navidson
              Record, Truant offers few concrete details about Zampanò's
              character or past, citing only information learned from his former
              acquaintances. These include neighbors and various students and
              social workers, exclusively female, who volunteered as readers for
              Zampanò's research. Unable to even determine Zampanò's full name,
              Truant only confirms that Zampanò became blind some time during
              the 1950s, and was approximately eighty years old at the time of
              his death. Truant also learns that Zampanò was erratic and
              capricious in his lifestyle and writing habits, diagnosing him
              with graphomania. Danielewski made Zampanò blind as a reference to
              blind authors Homer, John Milton and Jorge Luis Borges.

            <p class="character3">
              Pelafina, more commonly referred to as simply "P.", is Johnny's
              institutionalized mother who appears in the appendix to the text.
              Her story is more fully developed in The Whalestoe Letters.
