      <p class="intro-text">
        House of Leaves is the debut novel by American author Mark Z.
        Danielewski, published in March 2000 by Pantheon Books. A bestseller, it
        has been translated into a number of languages, and is followed by a
        companion piece, The Whalestoe Letters.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        The novel is written as a work of epistolary fiction and metafiction
        focusing on a fictional documentary film titled the Navidson Record,
        presented as a story within a story discussed in a handwritten monograph
        recovered by the primary narrator, Johnny Truant. The narrative makes
        heavy use of multiperspectivity as Truant's footnotes chronicle his
        efforts to transcribe the manuscript, which itself reveals the Navidson
        Record's supposed narrative through transcriptions and analysis
        depicting a story of a family who discovers a larger-on-the-inside
        labyrinth in their house.
      </p>

      <p class="intro-text">
        House of Leaves maintains an academic publishing format throughout with
        exhibits, appendices, and an index, as well as numerous footnotes
        including citations for nonexistent works, interjections from the
        narrator, and notes from the editors to whom he supposedly sent the work
        for publication. It is also distinguished by convoluted page layouts:
        some pages contain only a few words or lines of text, arranged to mirror
        the events in the story, often creating both an agoraphobic and a
        claustrophobic effect. At points, the book must be rotated to be read,
        making it a prime example of ergodic literature.
      </p>

      <p class="intro-text">
        The book is most often described as a horror story, though the author
        has also endorsed readers' interpretation of it as a love story. House
        of Leaves has also been described as a "satire of academic criticism."
