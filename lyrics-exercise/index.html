      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>
        We were floating for days<br />
        We were flying the way<br />
        That doves do<br />
        And I loved you<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We were sailing the sky<br />
        Watching the clouds passing by<br />
        Like a dreamland, where should we land?<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, we were invincible<br />
        That's what they said<br />
        So indivisible<br />
        Wherever we went<br />
        Higher and higher, yeah<br />
        I guess that we had it all<br />
        Light up the sky and then<br />
        We thought that we'd never fall<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        You were my Hindenburg lover, we were flying away<br />
        Then we took a wrong turn and it was all up in flames<br />
        And now I'm staring at the wreckage tryin' to make it okay<br />
        Oh, yeah<br />
        And I guess I got burned from the scars on my heart<br />
        And I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't know from the start<br />
        That there was something in between us that would tear us apart<br />
        Oh, yeah<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        I can still see your face<br />
        Looking back through the flames<br />
        And I search it<br />
        Was it worth it?<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        No I don't mind the smoke<br />
        But your tears make me choke<br />
        Are you okay? Should I go away?<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, we were invincible<br />
        That's what they said<br />
        So indivisible<br />
        Wherever we went<br />
        Higher and higher, yeah<br />
        We thought that we'd never fall<br />
        Light up the sky and then<br />
        I guess that we had it all<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        You were my Hindenburg lover we were flying away<br />
        But then we took a wrong turn and it was all up in flames<br />
        And now I'm staring at the wreckage tryin' make it okay<br />
        Oh, yeah<br />
        And I guess I got burned from the scars on my heart<br />
        And I'd be lying if I said I didn't know from the start<br />
        That there was something in between us that would keep us apart<br />
        Oh, yeah<br />
      </p>
