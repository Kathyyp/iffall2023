    <h1>Braised Pork Rice</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lu Rou Fan, also known as Taiwanese Braised Pork Rice, is a beloved and
      iconic dish in Taiwanese cuisine. It consists of tender, succulent pieces
      of pork belly or minced pork that have been slow-cooked to perfection in a
      fragrant and savory soy sauce-based mixture. This luscious pork is then
      served atop a steaming bowl of fluffy white rice, creating a harmonious
      blend of textures and flavors.

    </ol>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Hand chop pork belly into small stripes, YES, hand-chopped pork belly, a
        lot of manual work, but trust me, it is worth it! You want to have a
        little bit of skin, fat, and meat in each slice (Refer to the video
        tutorial for more information)
      </li>
      <li>
        Saute in the Instant Pot for 2-3 minutes or until it is no longer pink
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in soy sauce, dark soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine, five-spice
        powder, sugar, and mix
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in 2 cups of water and set the Instant Pot to “pressure cook” for
        20 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        After 20 minutes, quick release and add in 1 cup of fried dried
        shallots. Mix well to ensure everything is combined
      </li>
      <li>Pressure cook for another 15 minutes and let it natural release</li>
      <li>
        OPTIONAL: if you want to make marinated eggs, instead of natural
        release, do a quick release and add in 8 peels of hard-boiled eggs and
        let it simmer for another 30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
